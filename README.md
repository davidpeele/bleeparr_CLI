# Bleeparr_CLI 1.1


üöÄ  **Bleeparr_CLI** is a tool for automatically detecting and censoring profanity in videos by muting bad words based on subtitles and AI speech recognition (Whisper).

It uses a smart multi-layered strategy:
- Subtitle scanning for obvious profanity
- Whisper AI transcription (small + medium fallback) for audio verification
- Final fallback to mute entire subtitle segments if needed
- Fast, safe, accurate censoring!

Big thanks to mmguero for his awesome (and better) tools that gave me the ideas for this:

üÜï Changelog: Bleeparr v1.1

üîä New Features
- Whisper Multi-Model Fallback: If Whisper Small misses a known bad word, it will retry using Whisper Medium before falling back to subtitle-based muting.
- Flexible Censorship Display: New flag --alert-censoring-off allows disabling asterisk-style censoring for debugging/logging clarity.
- More Accurate Clip Extraction: Extracted clips are now tightly trimmed to subtitle segment times, greatly reducing Whisper processing time.
- Soft Matching for Swears: Fuzzy matching allows detection even when Whisper uses slight word variations (e.g., ****in vs ****ing).
- Better Logging: Each clip now logs the subtitle segment number and which words were found there.
- Cleaner Output: Summary includes mute counts by detection method.

üß∞ Improvements
- Boosted audio clip loudness by default (+6dB) for better Whisper accuracy.
- Improved CLI structure and argparse error handling.
- Supports subtitles with multiple bad words in a single line.

| `--output-suffix`      | Suffix to append to final output filename                   | *(edited by Bleeparr)*     |

Example command:
```
# Basic use with automatic subtitle detection and default options
python3 bleeparr.py --input my_video.mkv

# Use a custom list of swear words
python3 bleeparr.py --input my_video.mkv --swears custom_swears.txt

# Boost audio by 10 dB and disable subtitle cleanup
python3 bleeparr.py --input my_video.mkv --boost-db 10 --no-keep-subs

# Run only Whisper Small and fallback subtitle mute
python3 bleeparr.py --input my_video.mkv --bleeptool S-FSM

# Disable alert masking to show full swear words in terminal
python3 bleeparr.py --input my_video.mkv --alert-censoring-off

# Run and delete the original file afterward
python3 bleeparr.py --input my_video.mkv --delete-original```

üß† Advanced Notes

	‚Ä¢	Subtitles required: Bleeparr will try to extract embedded subtitles, or download them automatically using Subliminal.
	‚Ä¢	Audio formats: Should work with most common formats (AAC, EAC3, Vorbis, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Final Output: Video is remuxed with muted audio at swear locations.
